                <p>As of now, I am a Junior Computer Science student at Florida Polytechnic University. 
                    My interests include: full-stack web development, software development, fitness, and gaming.
                    As a kid, I was always interested in technology and the intricasies of how we make everything work.
                    Now, as a college student, this desire is stronger than ever as I constantly search for new ways 
                    to learn and expand my knowledge as I hope to make an impact within the industry. 
                </p>
